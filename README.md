# ConnectedColors

This app is developed in Swift 4.0 and uses Multipeer Connectivity framework, which lets iOS devices to communicate via Bluetooth.

Multipeer Connectivity

The Multipeer Connectivity framework supports the discovery of services provided by nearby devices and
supports communicating with those services through message-based data, streaming data, and resources (such as files).
In iOS, the framework uses infrastructure Wi-Fi networks, peer-to-peer Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth personal area networks
for the underlying transport. In macOS and tvOS, it uses infrastructure Wi-Fi, peer-to-peer Wi-Fi, and Ethernet.
